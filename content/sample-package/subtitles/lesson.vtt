Chapter 1: Core Synchronization Concepts

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
The Master Clock is the heart of our system

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
It coordinates all media elements with precision

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Each manager subscribes to clock events

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Drift correction happens every 200 milliseconds

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Maintaining synchronization within 50ms tolerance

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Video frames are tracked using requestVideoFrameCallback

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Audio pitch is preserved using WebAudio API

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Subtitles update based on the global timeline

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
HTML content switches at precise moments

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
The system supports multiple playback rates

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
From half speed to double speed

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
All while maintaining perfect synchronization

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
This enables effective educational content delivery

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
